# DeSoy 🌱 

> Why wait for harvest to get paid? 💰

## Overview 🎯

DeSoy is a decentralized platform that enables farmers to access upfront capital by tokenizing their future harvests and offering them to global investors. It addresses a major pain point in agriculture: the mismatch between the moment when farmers incur production costs and when they actually receive revenue from the sale of crops. By bridging this liquidity gap, DeSoy provides farmers with the resources they need at the most critical moment, the planting season, while offering investors real-world yield backed by tangible assets.

## How It Works 🔄

The platform allows verified farmers to list their crop receivables through a simple onboarding flow:
- 🔐 Digital identity verification via Civic
- 📜 Smart contracts deployed on Flare Network
- 💼 Direct investment in crop-backed positions
- 🤝 Automatic payouts upon harvest completion

DeSoy eliminates the need for traditional financial intermediaries, offering a direct and transparent relationship between capital and agriculture. It also creates a new asset class within decentralized finance by bringing real-world agricultural production to the blockchain. The use of Flare enables low-cost, secure, and programmable settlements, ensuring a seamless experience for all users.

## Business Model 📊

DeSoy generates revenue through:
- 💸 1% fee on successful funding rounds
- 🏦 Small platform fee on investor withdrawals
